Need a new UI to incorporate the new requirements
home screen: 
1. show all users
2. search users
3. delete all users 

inventory 
all tables and fields needed
1. products (product_name required, category required, price required, 
quantity > 0) quantity should have + / - button next to it.

categories: car model(a few of them), 
car parts(outer shield, seat trim, headrest guide), 
miscellaneous (screws, tapes, etc)

should have categories and items.
they can choose a category to view, and then get a list of every item in 
that category.

delete behavior:
what if category is deleted? Then all products in that category are deleted.
