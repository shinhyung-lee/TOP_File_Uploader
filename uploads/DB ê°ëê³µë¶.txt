what is a cluster?
table -> DB -> cluster
-CREATE TABLE
-DROP TABLE tablename;
-DISTINCT
-SELECT * is a bad style in production code
varchar(80) - a data type that can store arbitrary charater strings up to 80 characters in length.
int - normal integer type
real - type for storing single precision floating-point numbers
date - self-explanatory

postgres supports the standard SQL types int, smallint, real, double precision, char(N), varchar(N), date, time, timestamp, and interval, as well as other types of general utility and a rich set of geometric types.

point - PostgreSQL specific data type.
CREATE TABLE cities (
	name 		varchar(80),
	location 	point
);

Many developers consider explicitly listing the columns better style than relying on the order implicitly.
INSERT INTO weather (date, city, temp_hi, temp_lo)
	VALUES ('1994-11-29', 'Hayward', 54, 37);

-SELECT statement

boolean expressions in WHERE 
(AND, OR, and NOT allowed)

-DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT city
	FROM weather;

LIKE, SIMILAR TO, POSIX Regular Expressions
string LIKE pattern [ESCAPE escape-character]
string NOT LIKE pattern [ESCAPE escape-character]

-An underscore (_) in pattern stands for (matches) any single character; a percent sign (%) matches any sequence of zero or more characters.

substring with pattern, escape-character
<DELETION>
`DELETE FROM weather WHERE city = 'Hayward';`
DELETE FROM tablename; will remove all rows from the given table! Be careful.

Chap 3. Advanced Features
Views
-can create a view over the query,  which gives a name to the query that you can refer to like an ordinary table

CREATE VIEW myview AS
    SELECT name, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date, location
        FROM weather, cities
        WHERE city = name;

SELECT * FROM myview;
